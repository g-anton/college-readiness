          Start by speaking with your advisor about the possibility of taking
          accelerated math courses. Studies have shown students who partake in
          higher level, rigorous courses are more likely to further their
          academic succes in college. Consider taking Alegbra 1 to then move
          onto to a calculus track to prepare.

          After speaking with your advisor set up a meeting with a tutor. This
          will be benefical if you find the coursework to be a bit of a
          challenge. A tutor will assit you not only with assignments but
          provide you with additional tools for overall structure. This is a
          great resource to prepare for college!
