          Start by speaking with your advisor about the possibility of taking
          accelerated math courses. Studies have shown students who partake in
          higher level, rigorous courses are more likely to further their
          academic succes in college. Consider taking Alegbra 1 to then move
          onto to a calculus track to prepare.
        </p>
       <p>
          Not only is it a good idea for you to discuss math courses but talk
          about Advance Placement classes too. These are college level courses
          applicable for college credit if you pass with a "3" or higher. Many
          college and universities recognize the credits which go towards
          earning your associates degree (AA) in a shorter time-frame. Another
          way to recieve college credits during highschool is through Dual
          Enrollment offered by your high school, local college, or online. Dual
          Enrollment courses are open to tenth, eleventh, and twelfh graders.
          The credit earned applies to both high school and and college
          requirements. The best part is the courses are available for free to
          students in public, private, and home education programs.

          After speaking with your advisor set up a meeting with a tutor. This
          will be benefical if you find the coursework to be a bit of a
          challenge. A tutor will assit you not only with assignments but
          provide you with additional tools for overall structure. This is a
          great resource to prepare for college!
        </p>
         <p>
          If your school does not offer tutoring servies another tool would be
          searching the internet for free resources. A great resource is
          Schoolhouse.world created by the CEO of Khan Academy. An opportunity
          for students to join online group study sessions, SAT bootcamps, and
          live homework help everyday.

          Advisor can collaborate make sure that all students have equitable access to a college 
          counseling program that encourages the culture of going to college. Speaking with your
          advisor is highly recommended because they're the ones who know all the information
          about your major, like what kind of classes you'll need to take. Every semester you
          should schedule a meeting with your advisor, so you can stay on track with your classes.
          You don't want to spend extra money on classes.   
          </p>
          <p>
          It is important to talk to other peers about what they understand and
          want to know about college. Consider join clubs or collaborate groups
          to help ease the transition when starting your first college semester.
          Communication is key to not getting overwhelmed when it comes to
          school and learning how to balance everything is helpful to making it
          an easy and stress-free semester.

          A tip for when it is time to pick classes both in high school and college!
        <p>
        <p>
          It is important for students to choose their classes before their
          enrollment date. Atleast a week or two prior to your enrollment date
          you should start choosing your classes. That way you may have enough
          time to carefully select which classes you need to take to continue
          onward with your studies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also once you are enrolled in your classes most professor have their
          syllabus available online. It is suggested that students take a moment to
          read through the syllabus before the semester begins so they know what
          is expected of them for that course. You may even evaluate ahead of time
          if you happen to need a change of class or to even drop a class.

          It is never too early to start looking at colleges you would like to
          attend. Start by creating a list of your hobbies, interests, and
          majors you would be interested in studying. From the list find 12
          schools whether it be international, national, or local whichever is
          best fit for you. Once you found the 12 narrow it down to 6 colleges.
          This will be a reference to look back on during junior year to know
          where you are interested in going and make picking the right college
          an easier process. A website we found helpful with chosing
          college is Floridashines.org.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you complete the list, take your hobbies and interests and look for school
          clubs to get involved in. College admissions look for well-rounded
          students who succeed in academics and extracurricular courses. Plus if
          you start a sport or club freshman year there is room for growth
          within the organization and you can learn life-time skills.

        </p>
        <p>
          Mental health typically affects the persons' behaviour, thinking, feeling and mood. Most college students tend to forget about their mental health because they're too focus about schooling and other things. "1 in 5 U.S. adults experience mental health illness each year."
